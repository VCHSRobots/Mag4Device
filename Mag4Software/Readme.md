# Software for the Mag4 Device

This folder contains all software that was developed for the Mag4 project.  The two 
main areas are: Software for Raspberry PICO that resides on the device itself, 
and software for the RoboRio.

The software includes all the testing and development code that was writen for the
project.  If you simply want to use the device, then all you need is the class Mag4 
writen in Java for the RoboRio.  This class is found in ../src/main/java/frc/robot/Mag4.java.
