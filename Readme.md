# Mag4 Project -- 4 Way Interface for SRX-MAG Encoders

## Background

The SRX-MAG Encoder developed by Cross the Road Electronics has
been a mainstay for FRC Robots for many years.  It provides the ability
to read the angular postion of a shaft and provides two signals: a PWM
signal for abolute angle measurements and a quadrature signal for relative
measurements.  As of 2023, the device costs about $40.00.
